# Automatic Music Genre Classification
This group project aims to classify a short music sample between 10 genres (rock, jazz, classic, blues…) using machine learning techniques. The first part is a state of the art in Automatic Music Genre Classification. The second part is our own implementation, using several classic classifiers (Logistic Reg., Decision Trees, SVMs…) with hand-crafted features.
